# Java-Slytherlisp
Implementation of CSCI400 Slytherlisp in Java

Currently, deliverable 1 is fully completed with work starting into deliverable 2 and 3. 
This means the types and classes are complete, with evaluating and parsing being worked on.

The current types include:
- ConsCell 
- ConsList
- LexicalVarStorage
- Quoted, SExpression
- Symbol
- UserFunction
- Variable

Test cases are also being developed along with the Slytherlisp implementation. 
This is to ensure that functionality is correct and valid. 
The current tests include:
- ConsList
  - All methods within ConsList
  - Due to inheritence, works also for SExpression
